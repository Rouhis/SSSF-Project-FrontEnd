# SSSF-Project-FrontEnd

## Installation

Follow these steps to install and run the project:

```bash
 git clone project-name
```

```bash
npm install
```

The project uses the following environment variables:

- `VITE_API_URL`: The URL of the GraphQL API.
- `VITE_WS_URL`: The URL of the WebSocket server.

You need to create a `.env` file in the root of the project and set these variables. Here's an example of what your `.env` file could look like:

```properties
VITE_API_URL=https://your-graphql-api-url
VITE_WS_URL=wss://your-websocket-server-url
```

```bash
npm run dev
```

Other servers can be found from [SSSF-Project](https://github.com/Rouhis/SSSF-Project)
